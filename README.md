Angular4 quick setup

1. Find the hosts in the etc/ folder and edit

    add the line bellow all ip addresses "0.0.0.0 yourworkspace-yourusername.c9users.io" (without quotes of course)

2. Install the Angular CLI globally.
    
    npm install -g @angular/cli 

    (Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v 
    and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.)

3. Install all required dependencies.
    
    npm install

4. In package.json change the line
    
    "start": "ng serve -H yourworkspace-yourusername.c9users.io"

5. Go to the application folder and start the app in the terminal with 
    
    npm start
